# The Enabling Facility

DODAS is one of the [9 Thematic Services](https://marketplace.eosc-hub.eu/43-thematic-services) available in the context of EOSC-hub EU project. As such, the mission of DODAS is to provide support for the integration in to the PaaS core service of use cases and workflows required by those scientific communities seeking to exploit Cloud resources to accomplish their research activities.   
In order to make this integration processe more concrete the DODAS team provides not only the guidance for integrating the user community workflows, but also offers the possibility to test DODAS on a freely accessible cloud. **This is the so called Enabling Facility**.   
Data and compute resources of this Enabling Facility are offered by two distinct providers at INFN: [**Cloud@CNAF**](https://horizon.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/dashboard/project/) and [**ReCaS@Bari**](http://cloud.recas.ba.infn.it/horizon/project/). Both of them are based on Openstack middleware.   
The Enabling Facility is freely accessible through DODAS PaaS core services, upon successful registration and authentication on [https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/](https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/).
